<h3> Learn a little bit about me: </h3>
 
        <p>Hi! My name is Mahika Saxena and I am a professional makeup artist. Ever since I was little, I was always fascinated by my mom’s makeup and would love it when she put it on me in elementary school and middle school. I also loved the arts from when I was younger, whether it was dancing, painting, ceramics and sculpture, etc. I started to get more into makeup in high school. I taught myself how to do makeup by watching YouTube tutorials. I would learn about a  technique/product, see how popular YouTubers used it, and then buy it and practice on myself. This is how I slowly learnt most of the techniques I know now and built up my skills. I didn’t used to wear a lot of makeup in high school (just some concealer senior year maybe). However, a couple of my friends saw that I was getting good at makeup, so I would do theirs every once in a while. </p>
<p>Right before senior year, I visited my family in India and showed my aunt my makeup and explained to her how to use it. She told me that makeup was definitely my passion and that I could start doing other people’s makeup, and create a business out of it. So after that, with the help of friends, I started my “business.” I started taking more pictures of my makeup, got my own makeup business cards, marketed myself to others as a makeup artist, and advertised myself on websites, such as GigSalad. I also created a makeup page on FaceBook, my makeup instagram, and a YouTube channel with the help of friends, which is how I started getting clients. Then, in college, I started “marketing” myself to other college students and I would do a lot of makeup for halloween and other events, although my main practice was doing makeup on myself. </p>
<p>Throughout freshman year, I would do a full face of makeup almost every single day, so I could practice and continue to learn and get better. Then, the summer after freshman year, I got a job as a color consultant (makeup artist) at Sephora. There, I learned more skills and knowledge about both makeup and skincare and how to make sales selling makeup and do makeup quickly but correctly. At Sephora, I took classes taught by our Senior artists through “Sephora University” and went through a certification process called color 201 which certified us to do “mini makeovers” and “custom makeovers” on clients. I stopped working at Sephora mid summer before my junior year because I started an internship. I still continue to practice my makeup skills on myself as much as I can because not only does it make me a better makeup artist, but I enjoy doing makeup so much (the whole process of doing it, having the freedom to do whatever I want to do with my makeup, and then looking at the final result).</p>
<p>Throughout college I still did makeup on “clients.” I have done bridal makeup, bridesmaids’ makeup, and makeup on friends. I don’t do it as often on other people anymore just because of my hectic schedule at college, but I always make time for makeup for myself and friends. Also, after working at Sephora, I also learned the important value of skincare, so I believe that someone’s makeup can only look its best if proper skincare is done consistently, or else the makeup won’t show its true potential.</p>
<p>I love cruelty free makeup! I don’t have a favorite brand of makeup, but I look at the quality of a product rather than by brand or by price. Some of my favorite products include the Kat Von D setting powder, the continuous setting spray by Morphe, Tatti Lashes, Stila liquid liner, Colourpop liquid lipsticks, Becca and Ofra highlighters, and Essence mascaras. My absolute favorite eyeshadow palette that I think is perfect for any occasion and I have used so much is the Jaclyn Hill Morphe eyeshadow palette. I am a strong believer in doing my makeup to impress myself and no one else. Also my biggest pet peeve in makeup is not blending enough, so I’m always blending everything as much as I can.</p>
<p>My hobbies outside of doing makeup are dancing, doing karate, working out, and doing push-ups. I also love the color pink :)</p>
